Lab 8: Disjoint Sets

Disjoint set data structure implemented with support for the following operations

1. Make_set(x) - To create a new set with element x

2. Find_set(x) - Find the set to which x belongs

3. Union(x,6) - Union of two sets containing elements x and y

Implementation:

Enter :
1. "m" to add element "x".
2. "u" to do union of sets containing "x" & "y".
3. "f" to find leader of set containing "x".
4. "q" to exit.

Operation runs until exit value is entered.
